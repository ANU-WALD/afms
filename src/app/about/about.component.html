    The Australian Flammability Monitoring System (AFMS) web explorer provides easier and faster access to spatial
    information on:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Live Fuel Moisture Content (FMC), in kg water per kg dry matter expressed as a percentage.</li>
    <li>Uncertainty in the FMC values, in the same units.</li>
    <li>A Flammability Index (FI), providing a relative measure of fuel flammability between 0 and 1.</li>
    <li>Soil moisture content near the surface (0-10 cm), in m3 water per m3 of soil volume.</li>
    <li>Soil moisture content in the shallow soil (10-35 cm), in the same units.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The overarching objective is to assist users in better resources allocation in fire protection and response and
    improved awareness of fire hazards to people and property.
  </p>

  <p>
    The AFMS allows users to visualise and interpret national-scale information on FMC, flammability and soil moisture
    as maps or graphs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Data can be compared to preceding years or downloaded for further analysis.
